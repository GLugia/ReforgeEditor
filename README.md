# ReforgeEditor
Better Reforges is a configurable mod that changes what reforges every item can get based on their original stats.
As well as a personal QoL option to make every tool as fast as possible while maintaining their power. This option removes existing prefixes from all tools.

# Update
* If you have any issues please message me via Discord @Lulu#1628
* I am in the following servers if you don't want to add me: tModLoader, Calamity, Thorium, Anarchist

# !! WARNING !!
* Expect this mod to remove prefixes from existing items. Even if you are only updating.
* Enabling the "Max Speed Tools" config removes prefixes from all tools and disallows reforging them.

# TODO
* Heavily increase the price of reforging
* Remove the ability for items to gain a prefix on creation
* Finally add my own custom prefixes to help weaker classes a bit

# Changelog
* 1.0
  * Terraria 1.4 Release
